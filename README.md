# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detector (Python)

## About the Data
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) provides an unbalanced dataset containing numerical variables of 284,807 credit card transactions made within a span of two days in September 2013 to use for machine learning related projects. In this project, 492 transactions are fraudulent, making the positive class approxiately 0.172% of all transactions. Datasheet can be found and downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data)
